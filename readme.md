# UNITILITY - The Physics Unit Conversion Solution in Java

This project's goal is to design an elastic, fast, lightweight, and easy-to-use physical unit system, which will allow aggregate value and physical unit together and enable the easy conversion between units of the same type.
If you like my project, please hit the star button, thank you!

## Development status
This is an early development stage. Any contributions and suggestions are most welcome.
The project includes also other modules, to show an example of how this unit system can be incorporated into our calculation applications. In the later version, it will be removed, an only the unit package will stay.

## Specification

At current level of development following units are available:
- Temperature (K, C, F)
- Pressure (Pa, hPa, MPa, Bar, Psi)
- Density (kg/m<sup>3</sup>, lb/ft<sup>3</sup>)
- Kinematic viscosity (m<sup>2</sup>/s, in<sup>2</sup>/s)
- Dynamic viscosity (kg/ms, Pas, Ps)
- Power (W, kW, BTU/h)
- Thermal conductivity (W/mK, BTU/hftF)
- Mass flow (kg/s, kg/h, lb/s)

Each quantity consists most popular SI units and at least one Imperial unit.
